# PersomodGPT
Change the way ChatGPT is acting and its personality

# Introduction - What is PersomodGPT?
PersomodGPT is a GPT prompt in a file that can be modified to make ChatGPT act in a certain way, inspired by Chai and c.ai. It's basically like creating your own character and using it with Clyde and ChatGPT. Or modifying an existing c\*ai (c.ai/chai) character and making it a bit (or a lot) different.
